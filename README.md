## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. Vehicle weight, spoiler_angle and AWD have a non-random amount of variance.Ground_clearance and vehicle_length have the amount of random variance
2. P-value is 0.05>5.35e-11 so our slope is not zero
3. Depends on R-squared

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

- Lot 1 and Lot 2 are have almost similar mean and median and have specifications within given design . Lot 3 exceeds manufacturers specifications and has 170~ variance.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

- Values of PSI of Lot 1 and Lot 2 are not very different from the population mean whereas Lot 3 suspension coil is different from the population mean.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

- MPG, comfort of the car, engine, tires are the metrics for consumer decision. 
- Null hypothesis is our company and the competitors are not different in customer attraction and the alternative is we provide different but best customer experience.
- We can perform t-test with the competitors vechical data.
- t-test is conducted on means of all competitor.
